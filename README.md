Privacy Preserving Access Control System

As cloud computing becomes more prevalent, satisfaction of the security
requirements in such a computing model such as controlling the access to web
services and preservation of user privacy is receiving much more attention
recently. Companies tend to implement merely their core business as a web
service and outsource the rest on the internet. This underscores the mentioned
security requirements in service composition. In this project, we present the
prototype of a Privacy Preserving Access Control System for Service Composition
in Cloud Computing Environments. Along with controlling the access to resources,
this system preserves the privacy of users both in basic web services and in
automatically composited ones. Also, if needed, the system automatically
initiates a negotiation process with the user about its privacy.

### How to run

The prototype system has been implemented in form a web app using the [Django Web Framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/). You can refer to the framework's website in order to learn how to run the apps.
